# My-User-Dictionary
It will take the input (no case sensitivity) word from user, and search for it in my data set and then gives the meaning(s) for the word. My model rectifies spelling mistakes in input (if any) and verifies the close related word with you and help with the right meaning you probably searching for. If there are no close related words found for your choice? you need to re check the input word again
